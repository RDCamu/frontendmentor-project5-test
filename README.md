## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Form Validation
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

- Form Validation. I get to learn and apply html forms and form validation with javascript. 
- Using GET requests. I tried to use the GET request to access another HTML file for the success message to see if it will work and thankfully it did with Github pages. 


### Continued development

- Javascript
- Functions
- Events
- CSS selectors
- Pseudoelements and variables
- Responsive Design
- SASS CSS
- React

### Useful resources

- [HTML/CSS by supersimpledev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc&t=22302s&pp=ygUXc3VwZXJzaW1wbGVkZXYgaHRtbCBjc3M%3D) - This helped me learn HTML and CSS in a clear and concise manner. His examples and exercises are top-notch. This course is very beginner friendly so I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to learn HTML/CSS.

- [HTML/CSS etc Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is a great resource if you want an in-depth description of html tags, elements, css properties, etc.
